# AnniCounter
This app calculates additional anniversaries of special days, for example, 77,777,777 seconds or  222,222 minutes or how many hours you have been in love or engaged or married. It is also excellent for children's birthdays or grandparents, friends, etc. The app also counts down, for example if a long-awaited reunion is expected, or a baby's due date. You can also directly create calendar entries and you can share the results with others via e-mail, social media, etc.  Known Limitations: Creating calendar entries requires Android 4.0 or higher. With Android 4.4 and higher the selected photos are not displayed. The app needs the Joda-Time library (http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) for datetime calculations.
